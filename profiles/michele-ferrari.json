    "notes": "Threshold method: mostly sub-threshold and threshold work (91-101% FTP). Super-threshold rarely. Twice weekly threshold sessions. Medio (tempo) up to 20-40% of volume. Aggressive weight management with food weighing. Two-week max calorie deficit blocks. Famous quote: 'We never, ever, ever, ever, ever trained above threshold.'"
